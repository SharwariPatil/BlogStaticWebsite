            <h2 class="abouth"> 1. Who we are?</h2>
          We are a [Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com) backed startup solving
          the employability problem in India. We run a 6-month program for college
          students/ graduates to upskill themselves and break into software dev
          roles at top tech companies. We work on an outcome-based income sharing
          model and our students pay us only after getting placed with a salary
          greater than 5 LPA. We have been able to help students from Tier-2/3
          colleges get into companies like Amazon, Paytm, Park+, etc., and have been
          able to see a huge impact on student's learnings and careers. Currently,
          we are training 1500+ students, helping them become Full Stack Developers.
          We are looking for passionate folks to help us scale this :)
